# Hive OS PXE Diskless
Network boot for diskless BC-250 Rigs

This is just a temperorary fix while HiveOs gets off their asses, check if they've fixed.

This is a modified version of the Hiveos Pxe diskless to work with BC-250 Mining cards. 
The opencl version in hiveramfs says its 21.40.1 but its actually version 22.20 with rocm and fully is compatiable with the BC-250. 

Before you start, it took me a bit of time to figure this out, no thanks to the hive devs so iâ€™d be much appreciate if you donated a little wart. (I did save you a lot in nvmeâ€™s ðŸ™‚)

Thanks, James. 

Copy the install link below 
Then build the Ubuntu18 with ./deploy_pxe ubuntu18 --build (it will take awhile)
then re run ./pxe_setup.sh

Other Notes

Do not use ./deploy_pxe ubuntu18 --upgrade it will break the permissions on the BC-250 Rig. 

In BC-250 Bios change network boot to enable and Ipv4 PXE (Http isnt used do not enable)
In bios you can enable SVM if needed (but does not make a difference) but do not enable IOMMU it will not work.
